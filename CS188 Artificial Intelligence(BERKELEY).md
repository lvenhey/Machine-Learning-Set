# Lecture 1 : State spaces&uninformed search
  ## Search problems
  * Search problem is to find a solution which is a sequence of actions(a plan) that transforms the start state into a goal state
  * Reflect agent (consider the current state or its memory/do not consider future consequences)
  * planning agent (must have a model of how the world evovles in response to the actions took)
  1 Depth First Search (not the optimal solution/low effciency/takes small space)
  2 Breadth First Search (optimal/takes large space)
  3 Uninformed Cost Search
